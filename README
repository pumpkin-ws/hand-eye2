This repo has the eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand calibrations.

The robotic rpy should be intrinsic rotations represented by Tait-Bryan rotations. 
For rotation in the xyz direction, the composition of rotations in the fixed axes is a left-multiplication.

The eye to hand calibration is verified. Maybe the image quality is poor to have a good calibration result. 
Clean up the output and introduce glog for debugging and error logging.
